#Custom ELT Pipeline with Docker & PostgreSQL
Designed and implemented a complete ELT pipeline using Docker Compose to orchestrate multiple services (PostgreSQL source and destination, Python-based ELT script).
The pipeline automates data extraction, loading, and transformation between databases using a Python script.
Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with:

container orchestration using Docker,

fundamental Data Engineering concepts (ELT),

working with PostgreSQL databases,

scripting automated workflows using Pytho
